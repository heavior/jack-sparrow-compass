# **Naviguesser is coming to Burning Man 2025**

### **Imagine..**

You’ve finally escaped your camp duties and wander into Black Rock City, ready to explore, participate, and embrace whatever the playa has to provide. You’re an adventurer, open to side-quests and unexpected magic.

Climbing a piece of art or stumbling into a whimsical bar, you encounter a strange NPC. They share a tale from another time and realm and, if your charisma roll lands, hand you a mysterious artifact: a beautifully crafted object of wood and brass, with a sundial and a map of the city.

It resembles a compass—but it doesn’t point north.

The stranger calls it a **Naviguesser**. Every time you open your heart and trust the magic, it chooses a new path for you. Each destination is intentional, guided by the collective wisdom of thousands of burners.

You follow the arrow. And wherever it leads, it celebrates your arrival with a joyful dance—revealing art, tea ceremonies, plush pony rides, massage workshops, secret performances, exotic meals, artisanal bars, and other unforgettable moments.

By day's end, you complete your quest and discover a treasure chest. You return the artifact—but keep the memories and stories to tell.

Just another magical day at Burning Man.

### **The Vibe**

This is meant to be a **boutique experience**: intimate, delightful, and extraordinary—like receiving a room key at Hotel Ashram Galactica for the day, or being treated to a multi-course meal at the Black Rock French Quarter.

There is no VIP list, no privileged access. All it takes is **luck, an open heart, and the willingness to participate**.

This is the third year of the project. I’m still working out a few technical kinks, but the feedback so far has been overwhelmingly positive.

### **How It Works**

The Naviguesser is a custom electronic device that uses GPS and stores event schedule to guide player to curated nearby experiences.

The schedule includes two types of events:

* **Collective Wisdom:** Events submitted by camps for the WhatWhereWhen guide, upvoted by thousands of burners using [Burn Planner](https://burn-planner.web.app/). The selection is not random, excessive, or opinionated; each event made someone in the community excited.

* **Special Encounters:** Some camps go a step further and craft moments of magic specifically for players using the device. These events receive higher priority.

Everything is stored locally—no phone, no internet required.

**How to Participate**

There are four ways to be part of the magic:

**1\. Camps – Create special moments**  
 The device is designed to give the player the best possible day on the playa—no time wasted, just maximum experience. Camps can elevate that even further. When someone arrives holding the Naviguesser, they’re on a magical journey. That’s your chance to blow their mind: offer a bit of extra warmth, a trinket, a story, an extra spin, or anything that fits your camp’s vision. Become part of the story they get to tell tomorrow.

**2\. People – Join the cast as actors**  
 The burner matures from player to NPC—from experiencing the magic to creating it. With this project, you get to step into a role of your own choosing. Dress as a character from another time or realm, invent your legend, and wander the city. You interact with random burners and get to choose who you gift this experience to. It’s like being a free-roaming actor at Disneyland, but with dust and heart. Cast members get a device for themselves on another day, and I’ll be making something special for everyone who joins.

**3\. Wizards – Join the artificer guild**  
 I only have so many hands—and the project can go much further with yours. Join the artificer guild if you’re excited to help with graphic design, 3D modeling, story and promo, camp outreach, or engineering in any form (frontend, backend, mobile, microcontrollers—you name it). You’re welcome to shape the project with your ideas, as long as you’re ready to execute them.

**4\. Angels – Support the magic**  
 With new import tariffs and technical complexity, scaling this project to the desired scale is not feasible on my personal budget alone. I’m committed to a small batch—but with your support, we can gift this experience to many more burners. Donations help cover more electronic units, outsource wood and brass work to individual craftsmen, upgrade and scale manufacturing capabilities, and literally buy more time to polish the project.

### **Frequently asked questions**

**What if someone doesn’t return the device?**  
 This comes up a lot. The short answer: most people return it. The rest is collateral—the risk of bringing art to the playa.

The experience is designed to make it easy to return the device:

1. It starts with a vibe check from the actor. A bit of personal connection and a small legend goes a long way in encouraging players to complete their journey.  
2. Each device has a tag with a return address: a base camp on playa and a contact outside of it.  
3. There is a treasure chest waiting for the player at the return point.  
4. When the battery starts running low—or the journey reaches 24 hours—the compass only points to base.  
5. We'll try to place the return point at one of the friendly camps close to Esplanade.  
6. Once the battery is dead, the device becomes a trinket—a beautiful but dead artifact.  
7. After the event, we’ll run a social media campaign to recover some stragglers.

Since 2024, only one device is unaccounted for. The player reached out afterward but didn’t manage to complete the return. The biggest challenge for players was the remote location of the base camp at 9:00 & I. Lesson learned—we’re looking for a better spot this year.

We’re making a bet that **most burners are good people**—especially when it’s easy to act with good will.

**Can I purchase the device?**  
For many reasons, I’m not making them to sell.   
Yet, I will be gifting naviguessers to major project supporters. Actors are guaranteed to participate in the experience too.

Yet, co-authors and major donors will definitely be gifted one.
